# Computer-Architecture-Paper-Notes
This repository contains my questions and notes while reading computer architecture papers. I believe it's a good way to keep track of the things that I question while reading academic papers.

I share this repository because some of the questions that I asked and answered might help somebody else.  

## List of Papers
