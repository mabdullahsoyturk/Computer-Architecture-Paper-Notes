# Computer-Architecture-Paper-Notes
This repository contains my notes while reading computer architecture papers. I believe it's a good way to keep track of the things that I found important while reading a paper.

I share this repository because some of the notes might help somebody else.  

## List of Papers

1. [Energy Efficient Architecture for Graph Analytics Accelerators](Energy-Efficient-Architecture-for-Graph-Analytics-Accelerators)
2. [A Template Based Design Methodology for Graph Parallel Hardware Accelerators](A-Template-Based-Design-Methodology-for-Graph-Parallel-Hardware-Accelerators)
3. [System Simulation with gem5 and SystemC](System-Simulation-with-gem5-and-SystemC)
