## Notes:
* SystemC TLM 2.0 has become the main developing tool for virtual prototyping in recent years.
* TLM abstracts the communication mechanism from the hardware.
* TLM encapsulates communication between components in so-called **transactions**.
* Cycle-accurate simulations can be performed in SystemC with commercially available models but these models are **shipped as binary libraries** which makes them useless for microarchitectural research (they cannot be modified).
* The most mature cycle accurate open source system simulator is gem5.
* gem5 is incompatible to TLM models that exist in the industry and academia.
* Paper presents the coupling between SystemC and gem5. 
* Through this coupling, any SystemC module that implements the TLM base protocol can be connected to any gem5 module. 

### Background
#### SystemC and TLM
Although it is possible to model components on the RTL, SystemC is mainly used for highâ€“level system modeling. SystemC extends C++ to provide event-driven simulation. 

TLM is used to model the communication between SystemC components by function calls. Emphasis is on the functionality of the data transfers rather than actual implementation.
